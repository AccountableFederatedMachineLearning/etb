# Chaincode for asset-transfer-basic

This is the chaincode from the asset-transfer-basic example (because it was
easier to adapt the existing example rather than starting from scratch). 
It can be installed into the fabric test network by overwriting
`fabric-samples/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-java` with the content of
this directory and running the test network with it:

```
cd fabric-samples/test-network
./network.sh up createChannel -ca
./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccl java
```
A wallet can be then generated by:
```
cd ../asset-transfer-basic/application-java
./gradlew run
```

The only interesting change in the chaincode is the new transaction `Claim`. 
All other transactions are unused. At some point soon, `Claim` should be 
moved into a new contract.

```java
    @Transaction(intent = Transaction.TYPE.SUBMIT)
    public String Claim(final Context ctx, final String claim) {
```
